The HTTP_client project attemps to create a TCP server that functions as followed:


*	Firstly it will listen on port 22

*	It accepts muliple connections

*	It finds the IP address of the client

*	And it logs that address in a sepparate file

*	The TCP server will secondly start a new HTTP client for each new connection

*	...


More functions might follow but this will be the goal for now.
Note that this project is part of the Network exam from PXL-digital.
